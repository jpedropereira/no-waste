# NO WASTE!

No Waste is a Django application that collects users inputs regarding which ingredients they want to include or exclude and provides a list with a chosen number of recipes fitting the requirements.
Each recipe is displayed with its title, picture, list of ingredients already present, list of missing ingredients, carbs, proteins and calories. A suggestion on the what meal to prepare is generated based on which recipe has the minimum carbs and maximum proteins. 

## Requirements

In order to be able to use this application, you need to have an API key for Spoontacular's API (you can obtain it [here](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/) ). You should then assign the API key to an environment variable named "SPOONTACULAR_API_KEY".
A requirements.txt file is provided with this project.
